cd # Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel confident but know that there is room for imporvement.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had a good mixture of productive and unprodive struggles I was really starting to struggle with the for statement that require if statements but was able to go into the study hall and get some amazing guidance from Ellen and work through the problems as a team with Patrick. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice and learn the many possiblities of the var i as it has so many functions that can really help to simplify your code by refering to the arrays quickly. I think I will set out time in my calendar to start quizzing and practicing these for statements.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Not at the moment looking forward to the challenges it is great to be  able to come together as a team and find answers.
